An exponential decay has the formula $y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1exp(\beta_2 * x_i)$

Plot the data in `wtloss` from package MASS and estimate values for the coefficients of an exponential decay model.

Plot of the curve your coefficients imply.

Fit an nls model to the wtloss data.

Examine the model's diagnostics.

Plot the model and it's confidence interval.

Interpret the model's coefficients.

See what happens when you try some bad starting values.

Fit a polynomial to the data and make a prediction for the patients mass at day 1000.
