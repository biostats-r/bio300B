## Correlations

- With the Penguins dataset, find the Pearson correlation for bill length and bill depth for Gentoo penguins.
- Find the confidence intervals of this correlation. Is it significant?
- Calculate r^2^. How much of the variation in the data is explained by the correlation.

- Find the correlation between bill length and bill depth for
    - each species separately 
    - all species combined
- Make a figure to explain the apparent conflict between these results


This is [Simpson's paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson%27s_paradox).

## Continuous predictors

We want to test how bill length varies with body mass in Chinstrap penguins

- make a suitable plot to show the raw data
- fit a suitable model to the data
- interpret the model coefficients
- is the model statistically significant
- Examine the diagnostic plots. Is everything OK?
- Predict, with uncertainty, the mean bill length for Chinstraps with a mass of 3000 and 5000 g
- Add the regression line, with the confidence interval, to the plot.


## Categorical predictors

We want to test whether Adelie penguins differ in body mass between islands.

- Make a suitable plot to show the raw data
- Fit a suitable model to the data
- Interpret the model coefficients
- Is the model statistically significant?
- Include the predicted mass with confidence interval on the plot
- Do a post-hoc test to test for differences between pairs of islands (in real analysis only do this if overall model is significant) (Hint - use `multcomp` package but DO NOT use `library(multcomp)` - it also loads `plyr` and causes conflicts)
- plot the result of the post-hoc test and interpret the results

## Exploring diagnostic plots

Use the `influence_leverage_app()` from biostats.tutorials package to explore how the diagnostic plots look with a outlier, influential observation, or observation with high leverage.

Open the app and move the red point. Diagnostic plot on the left shows model without the red point, plot on the right includes the red point.

Try to:

- Make the R2 as high as possible
- Make the R2 as low as possible

And look at the different diagnostic plots
