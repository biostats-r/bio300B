# Task 1 2-way anova

- With the penguins data, fit models to predict body mass from species and sex with and without an interaction.
- Interpret the model coefficients.
- Using only the coefficients, what is the expected mass of male and female Gentoos with each model.
- Examine the models' diagnostic plots
- Test if the interaction improves the model.

# Task 2 ancova

- With the Gentoo data, fit models to predict bill length from flipper length and sex with and without an interaction.
- Interpret the model coefficients.
- Using only the coefficients, what is the expected mass of male and female Gentoos with flipper length 100 mm with each model.
- Examine the models' diagnostic plots
- Plot the raw data and the models, including confidence intervals.
- Test if the interaction improves the model.

# Task 3

- Use the MuMIn package to find the "best" model for predicting body mass of Adelie penguins.
- Is there a clear best model, or several good models?
