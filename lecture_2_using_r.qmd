# Basics of R

## Why code?

Why not just use Excel for everything?

## R as a calculator

```{r}
#| output-location: fragment
6 * 7

(2 + 5) * 8
```


::: notes

order of operations 

-    Parentheses
-    Exponentiation
-    Multiplication and division
-    Addition and subtraction

:::


## Assigning

Assign object to a name

```{r}
#| output-location: fragment
x <- 6 * 7
x
x ^ 2
```

Forgetting to assign is a very common error

::: notes
`<-` is the preferred assignment operator
some people use `=` (but can cause problems)
don't use `<<-` unless you know what you are doing
never use `->` - subverts the usual order of operations
:::

## Functions

```{r}
rnorm(n = 4, mean = 2, sd = 2)
```

Function name followed by brackets

Arguments separated by comma

Don't include an argument - uses default

Don't need to name arguments if in correct order

```{r}
#| eval: false
rnorm(4, 2, 2)
```

::: notes
`rnorm` is a function that generates random numbers from a normal distribution
good idea to name arguments for clarity
:::

# Data types

## Vectors

All elements must be the same type

Atomic vectors

```{r}
c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)    # logical
c(1L, 5L, 19L)          # integer
c(3.14, 1, 1.9e2)       # double
c("cat", "dog", "fish") # character
```


::: notes
`L` suffix for integers
hierarchical order of types: logical < integer < double < character
:::

## Coercion

Automatic coercion

```{r}
#| output-location: fragment
x <- c(1, "dog")
mode(x)
x
```

::: fragment
Deliberate coercion

```{r}
as.numeric(x)
```
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Predict the outcome of

```{r}
#| output-location: fragment
c(1, FALSE)
```

::: fragment
```{r}
#| output-location: fragment
c("a", 1)
```
:::

::: fragment
```{r}
#| output-location: fragment
c(TRUE, 1L)
```
:::

## Subsetting a vector

```{r}
x <- c(5, 1, 4, 7)
x[2]       # extract single element
x[c(1, 3)] # extract multiple elements
x[-2]      # remove elements
x[x > 5]   # logical test
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Extract from

```{webr-r}
x <- c(1, 10, 3, 5, 7)
x[]
```

-   first element
-   last element
-   second and third element
-   everything but the second and third element
-   element with a value less than 5

## Matricies

2 dimensional

All elements same type

```{r}
m <- matrix(1:9, nrow = 3)
m
```

Arrays can have 3+ dimensions

::: notes
Arrays are mind-melting
:::

## Subsetting a matrix

```{r}
m
```

`[row_indices, column_indices]`

```{r}
#| output-location: fragment
m[1:2, 2]
```

## Lists

Each element of a list can be a different type

```{r}
x <- list(
  1:5,
  "b",
  c(TRUE, FALSE)
)

str(x)

x
```

::: notes
Lists are very important
:::

## Subsetting a list

```{r}
x <- list(1:3, "a", 4:6)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/train.png")
```

Can make a smaller list, or extract contents of a carriage

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/train-single.png")
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

```{r}
x

x[1]   # list with one element
x[1:2] # list with first two elements
x[[1]] # content of first element
```

## Named lists

```{r}
x <- list(a = 1:3, b = "a", c = 4:6)
x
```

Extract vector "a"

```{r}
x$a
```

::: notes
Many functions return named lists eg lm, glm, t-test
:::

---

From the following extract

```{webr-r}
x <- list(a = 1:3, b = "a", c = 4:6)
x
```

- The contents of the third element
- The third element still as a list
- The first and second elements as a list

## Data frames and tibbles

rectangular data structure - 2-dimensions

columns can have different type of object

special type of list where all vectors have same length

Tibbles are better behaved version of data.frame

```{r}
library(tibble) # part of tidyverse
df2 <- tibble(x = 1:3, y = letters[1:3])
df2
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Data.frames have row and column names

```{r}
names(df2)
rownames(df2) # not supported by tibbles - use a column instead
```

## Subsetting a tibble

With square brackets

```{r}
df2[1, 2]
```

With column names

```{r}
df2$y
```

Which method is safer?

Can also use `dplyr` package.

---

Extract the from 

```{webr-r}
ChickWeight

```

- the top ten rows
- the weight and Time columns

## Logical tests

Return TRUE or FALSE

- `a == b` TRUE if a equals b (test of equality - single `=` assignment)
- `a != b` TRUE if a not equal to b
- `a > b` TRUE if a greater than b
- `a <= b` TRUE if a less than or equal to b

Useful with subsetting, `ifelse()` or `dplyr::case_when()` 

## Boolean logic

logical conditions can be combined

```{r}
animal <- "cat"
number <- 3
```

- `&` AND - TRUE if **both** TRUE
- `|` OR - TRUE if **either** TRUE 
- `!` NOT - TRUE if FALSE 

```{r}
animal == "cat" & number == 7
animal == "cat" | number == 7
!animal == "cat" | number == 7
!(animal == "cat" | number == 7)
```


## Control flow

`if` statements for choice

```{r eval = FALSE}
if (logical_condition) {
  # run this code if logical_condition is true
} else {
  # run this code if logical_condition is false
}
```

`else` is optional

Use `&&` and `||` to return a single TRUE/FALSE

## loops

Often don't need an explicit loop - R is vectorised

```{r}
a <- c(5, 1, 4, 6)
b <- c(1, 7, 3, 4)
a + b
```

## `for` loops

`for` loops iterate over elements of a vector

```{r eval = FALSE}
for (element in vector){
  # run code here
}

```

::: fragment
```{r}
for (i in 1:3) {
  i ^ 2
}
```
:::

## `for` pitfalls

Need to pre-allocate space or slow

```{r}
n <- 10
result <- numeric(10)
for (i in 1:n) {
  result[i] <- rnorm(1)
}
```

Rarely need a loop - `purrr::map()`, `apply()` generally cleaner

## Better iteration with `map()`

```{r}
library(purrr) # part of tidyverse
lst <- list(a = 1:3, b = c(4, 7), c = 5:9)
map(lst, mean)

map_dbl(lst, mean) # returns vector of doubles
```

`apply()` for iterating over rows/columns of a matrix

# Style

## Code is communication

-   With your computer

-   With your collaborators

> "Your closest collaborator is you six months ago but you don't reply to email."
> --- Paul Wilson

-   With reviewers/examiners

Need understandable code

## Journal code archiving requirements {.scrollable}

### [Nature Journals](https://www.nature.com/nature-portfolio/editorial-policies/reporting-standards)

> A condition of publication in a Nature Portfolio journal is that authors are required to make materials, data, **code**, and associated protocols promptly available to readers without undue qualifications.

### [Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences](https://blog.cdnsciencepub.com/open-data-and-code-in-fisheries-and-aquatic-science/)

>  it is a condition for publication of accepted manuscripts at CJFAS that authors make publicly available all data and **code** needed to reproduce those results (including code to reproduce statistical results, simulation results, and figures) via an online data repository.

## Tidy code

The only way to write good code is to write tons of shitty code first.
Feeling shame about bad code stops you from getting to good code

## Naming Things

> "There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things."

> --- Phil Karlton

-   Names can contain letters, numbers, "\_" and "."
-   Names must begin with a letter or "."
-   Avoid using names of existing functions - confusing
-   Make names concise yet meaningful
-   Reserved words include `TRUE`, `for`, `if`

## Which of these are valid names in R {.smaller}


```{r}
#| echo: false
library(classquiz)
cq_add_form(
  form_url = "https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeLIUnzdTfBUqjr_X0MvF7JBDQgy_mndeZVsjgW4JR3tFRHSw/viewform?usp=header")
```

---

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| output: asis

cq_add_results(
  sheet_url = "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1v3jF5jzbd4bpsmf1x-cZpX1NmL4FAsR0tGIh-a5I_RU/edit?resourcekey=&gid=24040024#gid=24040024", 
  type = "multiple_choice_grid", 
  height = 500, 
  marginLeft = 170,
  domain = c("Yes", "No"),
  range = c("green", "orange")
)
```

## Names can be too long {background-image="figures/Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch_stationbord.jpeg" background-color="black"}

::: notes
Common in old FORTRAN code - save memory with short names 

exceptions

-   counter in a for loop
-   main object in a function
:::

## Naming convensions

| camelCase üê´      | UpperCamelCase    | snake_case üêç       |
|-------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| billLengthMM      | BillLengthMM      | bill_length_mm      |
| bergenWeather2022 | BergenWeather2022 | bergen_weather_2022 |
| dryMassG          | DryMassG          | dry_mass_g          |
| makeWeatherPlot   | MakeWeatherPlot   | make_weather_plot   |

## White-space is free!

Place spaces

-   around infix operators (`|>`, `+`, `-`, `<-`, )
-   around `=` in function calls
-   after commas not before

### Good

```{r, eval = FALSE}
gentoo <- filter(penguins, species == "Gentoo", body_mass_g >= 300)
```

### Bad

```{r, eval = FALSE}
gentoo<-filter(penguins,species=="Gentoo",body_mass_g>=300)
```

## Split long commands over multiple lines

```{r, eval = FALSE}
penguins |> 
  group_by(species) |> 
  summarise(
    max_mass = max(body_mass_g),
    mean_bill_length = mean(bill_length_mm),
   .groups = "drop"
  )
```

::: notes
Aim for a maximum line length of 80 characters
:::

## Indentation makes code readable

### Good

```{r, eval = FALSE}
positive <- function(x) {
  if (is.null(dim(x))) {
    x[x > 0]
  } else{
    x[, colSums(x) > 0, drop  = FALSE]
  }
}
```

### Bad

```{r, eval = FALSE}
positive <- function(x){
if(is.null(dim(x)))
{x[x >0]} 
else{
x[, colSums(x) > 0, drop  = FALSE]
}}
```

## Stylers & lintr

Use `styler` package to edit code to meet style guide.

Use `lintr` package for static code analysis, including style check

::: notes
Demo 
:::

## Comments

Use \# to start comments.

Help you and others to understand what you did

Comments should explain the why, not the what.

```{r}
#| eval: false
# Bad
# remove line 37 of the penguins dataset
penguins <- penguins[-37, ]
```


Try to make code self-documenting with descriptive object names

## Comments for navigation

Helps you find your way around a script

```{r, eval = FALSE}
#### Load data ####
...

#### Plot data ####
...
```

## No magic numbers

```{r}
# Bad
x <- c(1, 5, 6, 3, 6)
mean(x)
x[x > 4.2]
```
::: fragment
```{r}
# Good
x <- c(1, 5, 6, 3, 6)
x_mean <- mean(x)
x[x > x_mean]
```
:::

## Split analyses over multiple files

Long scripts become difficult to navigate

Fix by moving parts of the code into different files

For example:

-   data import code to "loadData.R"
-   functions to "functions.R"

Import with

```{r, eval = FALSE}
source("1-functions.R")
source("2-loadData.R")
```

Number files so they sort alphabetically in order of use.

## Don't repeat yourself

Repeated code is hard to maintain

Make repeated code into functions.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
my_fun <- function(arg1) {arg1 ^ 2}
my_fun(7)
```

Single place to maintain

## Encapsulate code

```{r, eval = FALSE}
make_figure_one <- function() {
  ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm)) +
    geom_histogram()
}

make_figure_one()
```
