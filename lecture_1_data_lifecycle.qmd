# Why do biologists need statistics anyway?

# Biology is applied data science!

 - Nearly all papers include data visualisation and analysis
 - Need to be able to understand the methods used to evaluate paper
 - Need to be able to make visualisations and analyses for papers, reports, theses

---
# Changing expectations

- FAIR and open science
- Reproducible research

# Experimental Design

Lecture 4

- Randomisation
- How many replicates do you need?
- Statistical traps

---
# Data entry


- Make your data easy to import.
- Proof read & data validation

- Lock data file. No more edits.

---
# Spreadsheets

Practical recommendations for organizing spreadsheet data to reduce errors and ease later analyses.
- be consistent
- write dates as YYYY-MM-DD
- do not leave any cells empty
- put just one thing in a cell
- organize the data as a single rectangle (rows = subjects; columns = variables;  single header row)
- create a data dictionary
- do not include calculations in the raw data files
- do not use font, colour or highlighting as data
- choose good names for things
- use data validation to avoid data entry errors
- save the data in plain text files.

# Examples

When is 1-9-2021?

Sex coded as 0 & 1


---
# Data importing

R can import almost any data type.

- CSV files with `readr`
- Excel files with `readxl`
- shapefiles with `sf`
- NetCDF with `ncdf4`

---
# Data cleaning

- Process your data with code
- Reproducible analyses
- `tidyverse` (Lecture 2)

```{r, echo = TRUE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
data(penguins, package = "palmerpenguins")
penguins |> 
  group_by(species) |> 
  summarise(
    n = n(), 
    mean_mass = mean(body_mass_g, na.rm = TRUE))
```


---
# Visualise with ggplot2 

```{r, echo = TRUE, fig.height= 3, fig.width=5}
library(ggplot2)
library(ggbeeswarm)
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = species, 
                     y = bill_length_mm, 
                     colour = species)) + 
  geom_beeswarm() +
  scale_colour_brewer(palette = "Set1") +
  labs(x = "Species", y = "Bill length mm", colour = "Species") +
  theme_bw(base_size = 16)
```

---
# Data analysis

- Huge number of statistical methods implemented in R
- Can implement new methods

This course will focus on
- Exploratory data analysis (5)
- Descriptive statistics (5)
- Linear models (6-7)
- Generalised linear models (8)
- Mixed effect models (9)
- Bayesian analysis (10)

# Communicate results with R markdown

Tradition
 - text in Word, code in R
 - copy figures, tables etc into Word
 - find mistakes. Return to step 2.

R markdown
- Code and text interwoven
- Reproducible, dynamic documents
- This presentation made with R markdown (`Xaringan::moon_reader`)

# Data death

```{r info-content, out.width="60%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/1-s2.0-S157495410500004X-gr1.jpg")

Natural degradation in information content associated with **data** and **metadata**—information entropy

???
  
- morphological dimensions from plants or animals  
- examined the availability of data from 516 studies between 2 and 22 years old
- The odds of a data set being reported as extant fell by 17% per year
- Broken e-mails and obsolete storage devices were the main obstacles to data sharing
- Policies mandating data archiving at publication are clearly needed

# What would happen if you lost all of your research data?

> I was focussed on creating high resolution, 3D time lapse videos of developing crustacean embryos, so all of my work was digital-based. **When I lost my laptop and backups, I lost 400GB of data and close to four years of work.** As a direct result I ended up getting an MPhil rather than the PhD I’d been working towards. I was hoping to have an illustrious career in science and for a time it seemed like everything would be stopped in its tracks.

# Back up your raw data!

- Keep raw data
- Multiple places
- Physical and cloud services
- Be paranoid!

---
# Archiving data

Many research funders and journals demand that data are archived.

- subject specific archives 
  - [GeneBank](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/)
  - [GBIF](https://www.gbif.org/)
- Generalist repositories
 - [DRYAD](https://datadryad.org/stash)
 - [OSF](https://osf.io/)
 - [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/)
- University based
   - [DataverseNO](https://dataverse.no/dataverse/uib)

# FAIR principles

- Findable
- Accessible
- Interoperable
- Reusable
  
Meta data is as important as data.

Metadata is structured information that describes, explains, locates, and makes it easier to retrieve and use an information resource.

# Why `r fontawesome::fa(name = "r-project", fill = "steelblue")`?

+ free
+ open source
+ large and friendly user community
+ many statistical methods implemented
+ makes publication ready figures 
+ reproducible research
+ code is easy to share and publish.

# R GUI

```{r, out.width="100%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/Rgui.png")
```

You probably never need to open R directly.

# RStudio IDE

```{r, out.width="100%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/RStudiogui.png")
```

---
# Getting the best out of RStudio

- projects
 - keep track of everything
- code completion
- bracket matching

---
# Getting help

`?length` - find function length in open packages

`??length` - help search

```{r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
library(introverse)
get_help("length")# quotation marks
