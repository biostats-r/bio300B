## Why do biologists need statistics anyway?

Why do **YOU** need

-   data handling skills
-   data visualisation skills
-   statistics skills

## Biology is applied data science!

-   Nearly all papers include data visualisation and analysis
-   Need to be able to understand the methods used to evaluate paper
-   Need to be able to make visualisations and analyses for papers, reports, theses

## Changing expectations

-   FAIR and open science
-   Reproducible research

[Most scientists 'can't replicate studies by their peers'](http://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-39054778)

## Data life-cycle

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library("tidyverse")
data(penguins, package = 'palmerpenguins')
options(tibble.print_min = 3)
theme_set(theme_bw(base_size = 16))
```

```{dot}
//| label: data-life-cycle-dot
//| fig-height: 6.7
//| fig-alt: Graph of data lifecycle

digraph circo {

  graph [layout = dot,  rankdir = TB]
  node [shape = egg, fontsize = 18, style = filled, fillcolor =  steelblue1, fixedsize = FALSE, fontname = "Palatino"]
  a [label = "Design"]
  b [label = "Gather", fillcolor = lightgrey]
  b2 [label = "Enter"]
  b3 [label = "Import"]

  d [label = "Clean"]
  e [label = "Visualise"]
  f [label = "Analyse"]
  g [label = "Communicate"]
  h [label = "Archive", fillcolor = lightgrey]
  i [label = "Death", shape = diamond, fillcolor = lightgrey]
  j [label = "Find & Reuse", fillcolor = lightgrey]

  a->b->b2->b3->d->e->f->e
  e->g->h
  f->g->i
  e->d
  f->d
  d->f
  h->j->b3 [style=dashed, color=darkgrey, fontsize = 18, fixedsize = FALSE, fontname = "Palatino"]
  subgraph {
    rank = same; a; b; b2
  }
  subgraph {
    rank = same; e; f;
  }
  
  subgraph {
    rank = same; j; b3;
  }

}
```

## Experimental Design

Lecture 5

-   Observational studies vs experiments
-   Randomisation
-   How many replicates do you need?
-   Statistical traps

## Data entry

-   Make your data easy to import.

-   Proof read & data validation

-   Lock data file.
    No more edits.

## Spreadsheets {.scrollable}

Practical recommendations for organizing spreadsheet data to reduce errors and ease later analyses.

-   be consistent
-   write dates as YYYY-MM-DD
-   do not leave any cells empty
-   put just one thing in a cell
-   organize the data as a single rectangle (rows = subjects; columns = variables; single header row)
-   create a data dictionary
-   do not include calculations in the raw data files
-   do not use font, colour or highlighting as data
-   choose good names for things
-   use data validation to avoid data entry errors
-   save the data in plain text files.

## Data importing

R can import almost any data type.

-   CSV files with `readr`
-   Excel files with `readxl`
-   shapefiles with `sf`
-   NetCDF with `ncdf4`

## Data cleaning

-   Process your data with code
-   Reproducible analyses
-   `tidyverse` (Lecture 3)

```{r, echo = TRUE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
data(penguins, package = "palmerpenguins")
penguins |>
  group_by(species) |>
  summarise(
    n = n(),
    mean_mass = mean(body_mass_g, na.rm = TRUE))
```

## Visualise with ggplot2

```{r, echo = TRUE, fig.height= 3, fig.width=5}
library(ggplot2)
library(ggbeeswarm)
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = species,
                     y = bill_length_mm,
                     colour = species)) +
  geom_beeswarm() +
  scale_colour_brewer(palette = "Set1") +
  labs(x = "Species", y = "Bill length mm", colour = "Species") 
```

## Data analysis

Huge number of statistical methods

This course will focus on

-   Exploratory data analysis (6)
-   Descriptive statistics (6)
-   Linear models (7\--8)
-   Generalised linear models (9)
-   Mixed effect models (10)
-   Survival analysis (11)

### Future

- Code and text interwoven
- Reproducible, dynamic documents

::: notes
-   morphological dimensions from plants or animals
-   examined the availability of data from 516 studies between 2 and 22 years old
-   The odds of a data set being reported as extant fell by 17% per year
-   Broken e-mails and obsolete storage devices were the main obstacles to data sharing
-   Policies mandating data archiving at publication are clearly needed

## What would happen if you lost all of your research data?

> I was focussed on creating high resolution, 3D time lapse videos of developing crustacean embryos, so all of my work was digital-based.
> [**When I lost my laptop and backups, I lost 400GB of data and close to four years of work.**]{style="color: red;"} As a direct result I ended up getting an MPhil rather than the PhD I'd been working towards.
> I was hoping to have an illustrious career in science and for a time it seemed like everything would be stopped in its tracks.

## Back up your raw data!

-   Keep raw data
-   Multiple places
-   Physical and cloud services
-   Be paranoid!

## Archiving data

Many research funders and journals demand data archiving.

-   subject specific archives
    -   [GeneBank](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/)
    -   [GBIF](https://www.gbif.org/)
-   Generalist repositories
    -   [DRYAD](https://datadryad.org/stash)
    -   [OSF](https://osf.io/)
    -   [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/)
-   University based

## Data management plans

How data are to be collected and handled both during a research project, and after the project is completed

Write one before you start work.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("https://www.uib.no/sites/w3.uib.no/files/styles/content_main_wide_1x/public/20171119_benefitsdmp_tekengebied-1_large.png?itok=YnWxrDdr&timestamp=1616058199")
```

## FAIR principles

-   Findable
-   Accessible
-   Interoperable
-   Reusable

Meta data is as important as data.

::: notes
Metadata is structured information that describes, explains, locates, and makes it easier to retrieve and use an information resource.

## Why `r fontawesome::fa(name = "r-project", fill = "steelblue")`?

-   free
-   open source
-   large and friendly user community
-   many statistical methods implemented
-   makes publication ready figures
-   reproducible research
-   code is easy to share and publish.

## R GUI

```{r, out.width="100%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/Rgui.png")
```

You probably never need to open R directly.

## RStudio IDE

```{r, out.width="100%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/RStudiogui.png")
```

## Getting the best out of RStudio

-   projects
-   keep track of everything
-   code completion
-   bracket matching

## Getting help

`?length` - find function length in open packages

`??length` - help search
