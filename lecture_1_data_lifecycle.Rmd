- morphological dimensions from plants or animals  
- examined the availability of data from 516 studies between 2 and 22 years old
- The odds of a data set being reported as extant fell by 17% per year
- Broken e-mails and obsolete storage devices were the main obstacles to data sharing
- Policies mandating data archiving at publication are clearly needed

# What would happen if you lost all of your research data?

> I was focussed on creating high resolution, 3D time lapse videos of developing crustacean embryos, so all of my work was digital-based. **When I lost my laptop and backups, I lost 400GB of data and close to four years of work.** As a direct result I ended up getting an MPhil rather than the PhD I’d been working towards. I was hoping to have an illustrious career in science and for a time it seemed like everything would be stopped in its tracks.
