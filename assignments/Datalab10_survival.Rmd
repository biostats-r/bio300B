You have done an experiment where you have tested how the castrating bacterium
_Pasteuria ramosa_ affects survival of its crustacean host Daphnia magna.
Use the data below and follow the example from the lecture to

- Create a survival plot
- Test the hypothesis:
H0: Daphnia magna infected by Pasteuria ramosa has the same survival as uninfected individuals.
- Use the model to calculate the expected mean age at death for the two groups (infected and uninfected)
