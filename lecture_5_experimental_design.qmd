## Starting with a hypothesis

- Proposed explanation for observations
- Testable

Null hypothesis H<sub>0</sub> - no relationship  
Alternative hypothesis H<sub>1</sub> - relationship


## Testing a hypothesis - types of evidence


- Observational
- Computer simulations
- Experimental
- Meta analysis and systematic reviews


Which is better? Why are all needed?

## Randomisation

- reduces bias
- stratified random designs possible

## Unbalanced design

Is an experiment with 100 treatment subjects and 10 control subjects valid?

What about 57 treatment subjects and 53 control subjects?

Why might you get an unbalanced design

Want to test the effect of different fish foods

Mass of each fish measured.

Can each fish be treated as an independent observation in your analysis?

## Blinding

- Two videos: pigs bred for social breeding value, controls
- Count positive and negative interactions

- Same pigs. Video inverted.
