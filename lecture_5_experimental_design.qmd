## Starting with a hypothesis

- Proposed explanation for observations
- Testable

Null hypothesis H<sub>0</sub> - no relationship  
Alternative hypothesis H<sub>1</sub> - relationship


## Testing a hypothesis - types of evidence


- Observational
- Computer simulations
- Experimental
- Meta analysis and systematic reviews


Which is better? Why are all needed?

## Bad controls

After rotenone treatment have started, you want to test how the benthic fauna
of a river is affected by the treatment.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/design-bad-control.png")
```

## Conditioned samples

H~0~ : The parasite _Schistocephalus solidus_ does not affect food
intake of three-spined sticklebacks.

Design: You collect infected and uninfected fish from the
field and compare their food intake in the laboratory.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/design-conditioned.png")
```


## Replication

One treatment and one control measurement not enough

- Random variability
- Need replication
- Power analysis to estimate how many replicates needed


## Randomisation

- reduces bias
- stratified random designs possible

## Unbalanced design

Is an experiment with 100 treatment subjects and 10 control subjects valid?

What about 57 treatment subjects and 53 control subjects?

Why might you get an unbalanced design?

## Confounding factors

H~0~: age of a fish affects parasite resistance because host age affects the immune
system. 

But, size of a fish varies with
age. \
Size may also affect the immune system. Thus, size may be a
confounding factor in the experiment.

```


## Blinding

- Two videos: pigs bred for social breeding value, controls
- Count positive and negative interactions

## Examples

Are there any problems
with the following study
designs?

## Study 1

You want to test growth of salmon depending
on three different food types. 
You have three aquaria with
several fish and give one food type to each aquarium.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/design-aquaria.png")
```

## Study 2

You want to test if a virus enlarges the
liver cells of infected salmon.
You measure 60 cells, 30 from a fish you have infected and 30 from an uninfected fish, respectively.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/design-liver.png")
```

## Study 3

You have a _D. pulex_ population in an
aquarium and use these animals for an experiment.
You place the
daphnia individually in 70 ml jars, first the ones you will
use as a treatment group, and then the control group.
Then, you randomly place control and treatment jars in a climate chamber.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/design-daphnia.png")
```
